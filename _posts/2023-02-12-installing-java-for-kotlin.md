In the previous post, we setup a Spring Project using the Spring Initializr and created a super basic API. 

One of the prerequisites for the project was installing Java. The installation of Java itself is not really anything more than trivial, but there is a handy-dandy open-source project called Jabba which can manage our Java versions for us. 

So, today, we are going to run through setting up Jabba and installing a version of Java through it.
