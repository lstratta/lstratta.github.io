# Getting Started With Kotlin and Spring Boot

If you want to create a web app with Kotlin, you're going to need a few things. 

The first one of those things you're going to need a web server to be able to serve the stuff you're going to be creating; whether that is millions of users, or just a local project.

Next up, you might need a way to connect to a database so that you can write some Kotlin to query against it. After that you might need a way to create an API so that you can actually connect to the database.

These things, and so many more all come in this neat package called Spring Boot.

## Where do you get all these things? 

Well, the wonderful people over at Spring have put together this handy tool called the <a href="https://start.spring.io" target="_blank">Spring Initializr</a>.

It's a click-click-click-done wizard that then downloads a zip file with all the dependencies you need to get started writing your Kotlin app.

Here you choose your language, the Spring Boot version, add your roject metadata, and choose your JVM version.

## Dependency... heaven? 

You can also add a plethora of dependencies that are appropriate for you project. 

Want that web server we mentioned? You've got Spring Web. 

Want to connect a SQL database? Whack in Spring Data JDBC.

Want to make sure your data migrations are as slick as can be? Sprinkle in a bit of Liquibase.

There is an absolute boat-load of dependencies to choose from, so window shop a bit and see what will fit your requirements the best.

Only choose what you need though, you don't want to end up in dependency hell.

## Like Lego

Like every tutorial out there, we're going to put together a simple API to walk you through the process of actually running your first Spring Boot app. 

But don't you worry. I am going to help you start to work with more advanced topics in the future; all the stuff I wish I had been able to find when I started out.

For our simple API, we have chosen:
* Spring Web to allow us to have a server for our app and allow us to create a RESTful API
* Spring Data JPA to allow us to connect with SQL databases using the Java Persistence API
* H2 Database which is an in-memory database; great for testing.

All we need to do now is hit `GENERATE` and we're off to the races.
