# Meet The Kotlin Guide

In this repository, you will find a range of articles, tutorials, and examples covering topics related to Kotlin. As of writing, it will contain a lot of the tools that I use in my day-to-day work and is primarily a repository of knowledge for my own work, but please feel free to learn from it too!

Some of the topics that will be included from the get go are; Kotlin (duh), Spring and Spring Boot, Liquibase, Testcontainers, Gradle, and more.

To get started with the Kotlin guide, [please visit the repository here](https://github.com/lstratta/kotlin-guide) and if you find it useful, give it a star.
